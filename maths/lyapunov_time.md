#Lyapunov time

It's the characteristic timescale on which a dynamical system is chaotic. 
The Lyapunov time mirrors the limits of the predictability of the system.

Examples:
System 	Lyapunov time
Solar System 	5 million years
Pluto's orbit 	20 million years
Obliquity of Mars 	1–5 million years
Orbit of 36 Atalante 	4,000 years
Rotation of Hyperion 	36 days
Chemical chaotic oscillations 	5.4 minutes
Hydrodynamic chaotic oscillations 	2 seconds
1 cm3 of argon at room temperature 	3.7×10−11 seconds
1 cm3 of argon at triple point (84 K, 69 kPa) 	3.7×10−16 seconds
