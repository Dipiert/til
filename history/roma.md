# Secessio plebis

An secessio plebis was an informal exercise of power by Rome's plebeian citizens, similar in concept to the general strike.
During the secessio plebis, the plebs would abandon the city en masse and levae the patrician order to themselves.
Roma had five secessions between 494 BC and 287 BC.
