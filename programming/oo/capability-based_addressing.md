Capability-based addressing

In 1965, Jack Denis held that virtual memory as a pure computational storage system was too restrictive, modular programming would not become a reality as long as programmers had to bind together manually, by a linking loader or makefile program, the component files of an address space.

The segmented address space did not survive as a recongnizables entity, ostensibly because most programmers where content with one, private, linear address space and a handful of open files. The methods of address translation for segmentation were generalized by Dennis and his students into capability machines and, later, object-oriented programming.
