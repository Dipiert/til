The Tesler's law of the consevation of complexity states:

The total complexity of a system is a constant. If you make a userâ€™s interaction with a system simpler, the complexity behind the scenes increases.

The law originates from Lawrence Tesler (1945-2020), a computer scientis specializing in human-computer interactions who worked at Xerox, Appel, Amazon and Yahoo!
Tesler was influential in the development of early grahpical interfaces, and he was the co-creator of the copy-and-paste funcitonality.
